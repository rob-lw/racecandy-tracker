# Getting Started with Create React App
This project is the back-end for the Rarecandy subgraph https://github.com/rob-lw/rarecandy-tracker deployed at the hosted service [The Graph - Rarecandy Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/rob-lw/racecandy-tracker)

The front-end web interface located at https://github.com/rob-lw/rarecandy-tracker-frontend

[Rarecandy](https://rarecandy.xyz/) is a virtual publishing house for scarce digital and physcial collectibles on Ethereum blockchain.

The back-end generates the following data subgraph [Image](https://github.com/rob-lw/rarecandy-tracker/blob/master/Rarecandy%20deployed%20subgraph.png):
1. Total Assets Minted to date
2. Total Assets Sold to date
3. Sales volume to date 
4. Highest bid to date 
5. IDs of assets solds so it can be crossed refrenced at [Rarecandy](https://rarecandy.xyz/) 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
